You're right! I missed mentioning the click delay setting, which is important for devices that need delays between multiple clicks. Let me update that section:

# Device GUI Manager - Complete User Guide

🎯 **What This Program Does**
Automatically loads your custom mouse/keyboard profiles before launching games. Set it up once, then launch games with perfect controls every time!

📋 **The Four Tabs - In The RIGHT Order**

## 1. SETTINGS TAB ← START HERE FIRST!
**Purpose:** Tell the program where everything is located.

### MUST DO THESE FIRST:

**🖥️ Add Your Device**
- Click "Add" button in Devices section
- Enter device name (e.g., "Redragon M913", "Gaming Keyboard")
- Select device from dropdown

**📁 Select Device GUI EXE**
- Click "Select Device GUI EXE"
- Navigate to your device software folder
- Select the .exe file (e.g., `OemDrv.exe`)
- *Without this, nothing works!*

**🎯 Capture Import Button**
- Click "Capture Import Button"
- Enter number of clicks (usually 1)
- Device software opens automatically
- Move mouse over the "Import" button
- Press **F8** to record the location
- Success message appears, software closes

**📂 Set Device Profile Folder**
- Click "Set Device Profile Folder"
- Choose where your profile files are saved
- All your profiles will appear automatically

**⏱️ Set Click Delay (Optional but Important!)**
- Enter milliseconds in "Click Delay" box (default: 300ms)
- Click "Save Click Delay"
- **Why this matters:** Some software needs time between clicks
- **Use higher values (500-1000ms) if:**
  - Your device software is slow to respond
  - You're doing multi-click sequences
  - Import isn't working consistently

### Optional Settings:
- 🎨 **Colors**: Click "Pick" to change program color
- 🔢 **Sorting**: Choose how to order your games

## 2. GAME EDITOR TAB ← SETUP YOUR GAMES HERE
**Purpose:** Create "launch actions" for each game (one-time setup).

### How to Add a Game:
1. **Select Device** from dropdown
2. **🎮 Browse for Game EXE**
   - Click "Browse" next to "Game EXE Path"
   - Find and select your game's .exe file
   - Game Name auto-fills (you can edit)
3. **📄 Browse for Profile**
   - Click "Browse" next to "Profile Path"
   - Select the profile file for this game
4. **💾 Save the Game**
   - Click "Add / Update" button
   - Your game is now ready to launch!

### Optional Settings:
- ⏱️ **Game Launch Delay**: Wait time before game starts (after profile loads)
- ⏱️ **GUI Close Delay**: Wait before closing device software (default: 1000ms)
- 🚀 **Launch with EXE**: Start game after loading profile
- 🚪 **Close Manager**: Close program after launching

### Extra Features:
- **🖥️ Create Shortcut**: Makes desktop icon
- **🗑️ Remove**: Delete a game from your list
- **📁 Open EXE Folder**: Opens folder containing game

**Remember:** This tab is ONLY for setup, not for launching!

*(3-4 sections remain the same as before...)*

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### ⏱️ Delay Settings Explained
1. **Click Delay (Settings Tab)**
   - Delay BETWEEN clicks in multi-click sequences
   - Default: 300ms
   - Increase if: Clicks aren't registering, software is slow

2. **Game Launch Delay (Game Editor)**
   - Delay AFTER profile loads, BEFORE game starts
   - Default: 1500ms
   - Increase if: Game crashes on launch, needs time to initialize

3. **GUI Close Delay (Game Editor)**
   - Delay AFTER file selection, BEFORE closing device software
   - Default: 1000ms
   - Increase if: Profile doesn't finish loading before software closes

### 🎯 Efficiency Tips
- **Desktop Shortcuts** are fastest! Create them after adding games
- Set **sorting to "LastPlayed" → "Descending"** - recent games always appear first
- Add **profile notes** to remember setups: "FPS - Fast DPI", "RPG - Spell macros"

### 🔧 Quick Fixes
- **"Profile won't import"** → Check "Capture Import Button" was done in Settings
- **"Game won't launch"** → Verify .exe path is correct in Game Editor
- **"Can't find profiles"** → Click "Set Device Profile Folder" in Settings
- **"Nothing happens"** → Did you select the Device GUI EXE in Settings?
- **"Clicks aren't registering"** → Increase Click Delay in Settings

### ⚡ **Delay Troubleshooting Guide**
| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| First click works, second doesn't | Increase Click Delay to 500-1000ms |
| File dialog appears but nothing imports | Increase GUI Close Delay |
| Game starts before profile loads | Increase Game Launch Delay |
| Software closes before import finishes | Increase both Click AND GUI Close delays |

## 🎉 You're Ready!

**Simple Workflow:**
1. **Settings Tab** → Configure device (DO THIS FIRST!)
2. **Game Editor Tab** → Set up your games  
3. **Game Launcher Tab** → Play your games
4. **Profile Manager Tab** → Quick profile changes

**The Magic:** Double-click a game and it just works - profile loads, game starts, perfect controls every time!

**Remember:** If something doesn't work immediately, try adjusting the delay settings. Different devices need different timings!

**Set it up once, enjoy it forever! 🚀**
