## 💡 Advanced Features

Some device software requires multiple clicks to import profiles. Use "Capture Import Button" → enter number of clicks needed → record each click position with F8.

### ⚡ CLI/Shortcut Launching
Create desktop shortcuts that launch games with profiles pre-loaded:
```
XB_GUI_Profile_Manager.exe /launch "GameName" "DeviceName"
```

### 🎨 Theme Customization
- Settings tab → Colors section → "Pick" to choose background color
- Text color automatically adjusts for readability
- Settings are saved between sessions

### 📊 Launch Statistics
Track how often and when you play each game:
- Launch count increments automatically
- Last played timestamp updates on each launch
- Sort games by most played or recently played

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

- **"GUI Not Loaded Properly"**: Ensure your device is connected and its software is running correctly.
- **Profile not importing**: Check that import button coordinates are correct (re-capture if needed).
- **Profile not importing completely**: Make sure to give enough time before closing the GUI, use the timer function.
- **Device not appearing**: Make sure the device software EXE path is set correctly in Settings.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool is **unofficial** and not affiliated with or endorsed any hardware/software manufacturer.

Use entirely at your own risk — the author is not responsible for any damage, data loss, or issues caused to your devices, software, or profiles.

## 💡 Tips & Notes

> If your file explorer takes a long time to open (e.g., due to network drives or sleeping drives), just try importing again — it will properly load the profile.  
> Use the notes feature to document special keybindings or macro setups for each profile!  
> Regular backups prevent loss if you experiment with new profile configurations.
